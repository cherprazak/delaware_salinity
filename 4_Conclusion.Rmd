# Conclusion

With sea levels rising globally, there is a need to observe deltaâ€™s intake of 
saltwater as too much could result in drastic changes to how people rely on the 
freshwater upstream. This research takes streamflow and salinity levels from the 
Delaware Bay and upstream river to acknowledge any patterns. Estuarine salinity 
results observed in the bay were consistent with tidal flow [@whitney_simulating_2006]. 
It was also observable that tidal patterns could be seen upstream at a middle site in 
Wilmington and as far up at an upstream site in Trenton. Salinity levels were observed 
through specific conductivity sensors and corresponded with tidal flows. Streamflow 
was measured with discharge sensors and were found to be increasing over time with 
drastic drops in between years. In the years with low streamflow, salinity levels 
were observed to be higher than the years with high streamflow. With trends pointing 
towards a decrease in streamflow, the salt front will be able to continue travelling 
further upstream to where it could damage equipment and cause drinking water issues 
for the millions of people that rely on the Delaware River. Therefore, continuing to 
monitor the yearly variation in streamflow is impertinent towards assuring that the 
Delaware River can provide quality drinking water to those in surrounding areas.
