# Abstract

As sea levels rise around the world, destruction has been brought down on coastal 
regions. Freshwater outlets such as deltas allow saltwater to flow upstream under 
the freshwater as it is denser. With this water flowing upstream it can cause damage 
to the river banks with erosion and corrosion of structures and equipment. Using 
discharge and specific conductivity data from the Delaware River, this research 
looks for patterns of increasing salinity levels upstream. Using these sources, it 
was observed that as streamflow decreased, salinity increased. Since streamflow is 
ultimately increasing, issues with saltwater upstream donâ€™t seem to be an issue. 
However, monitoring the yearly variation in streamflow is important to continue 
for the quality of freshwater that is used for drinking water relied on by millions 
of people.
