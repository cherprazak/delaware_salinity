## Discharge at Upstream Site

### Data Retrieval
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Upstream Site
site_no1 <- "01463500" 

q1 <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = site_no1, 
                parameterCd = '00060', 
                startDate = '1995-09-30', 
                endDate = '2021-01-01') %>% 
  rename(q_cfs = X_00060_00003) %>% 
  addWaterYear(.) %>%
  select(-agency_cd, -X_00060_00003_cd)
```

```{r}
#Monthly averages at Upstream site
q_month_means <- q1 %>%
  mutate(month = month(Date),
         year = year(Date)) %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarize(q_mean = mean(q_cfs, na.rm = T),
            q_min = min(q_cfs, na.rm = T),
            q_median = median(q_cfs))
```

### Mean Discharge
```{r, fig.cap= "**Figure 4.** Trends for all 12 months mean discharge data from 1995 to 2021 for the upstream site in the Delaware River."}
#Trend of all 12 months at Upstream Site 
ggplot(q_month_means, aes(x = year, y = q_mean)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~month, scales = 'free') +
  scale_y_log10()+
  ylab('Mean Discharge (cfs)') +
  xlab('Year')
```
On **Figure 4.** we see all of the mean discharge values for the water years from 
1995 to 2021. Going month to month, it is difficult to see any notable trends and 
when the Mann-Kendall test is applied, it proves that most of the trends are
non-significant. November through May have much higher mean discharge values from
winter weather, which I am avoiding in my research mainly due to the application of
road salt. June and July values are a little bit lower, but still have a slight
increasing trend over the years. Let's look at the plots for August and September to
see how their mean discharge values behave. 

### Mann-Kendall Test of August and September Trends

```{r, fig.cap= "**Figure 5.** August trends for the upstream site in the Delaware River using mean discharge data from 1995 to 2021."}
#Upstream Site plot of August Trends
q_aug <- q_month_means %>%
  filter(month == 8)

ggplot(q_aug, aes(x = year, y = q_mean), size = 2) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_log10()+
  ylab('Mean Discharge (cfs)') +
  xlab('Water Year')

#Mann-Kendall Test
mk.test(log10(q_aug$q_mean))

sens.slope(log10(q_aug$q_mean))

up_aug_mk <- sens.slope((q_aug$q_mean))

print(up_aug_mk)
```
The month of August has a much more visible trend of mean discharge increasing. 
So when we apply the Mann-Kendall test, we find a significant trend with a slope 
of 150.27. Proving that discharge is increasing over time especially in August.

```{r,fig.cap= "**Figure 6.** September trends for the upstream site in the Delaware River using mean discharge data from 1995 to 2021."}
#Upstream Site plot of September Trends
q_sept <- q_month_means %>%
  filter(month == 9)

ggplot(q_sept, aes(x = year, y = q_mean), size = 1.5) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_log10()+
  ylab('Mean Discharge (cfs)') +
  xlab('Water Year')

#Mann-Kendall Test
mk.test(log10(q_sept$q_mean))

sens.slope(log10(q_sept$q_mean))

up_sept_mk <- sens.slope((q_sept$q_mean))

print(up_sept_mk)
```
Now Looking at **Figure 6.** for September, there does not seem to be any visible trends 
and the majority of the points lie between 3000 and 6000 cfs with some much higher 
outliers. Applying the Mann-Kendall test gives us a non-significant trend with a 
2.8 slope. Telling us that the average discharge is also increasing for the month 
of September, just not as much as August. 

It makes sense for August to have larger values than September because of how 
large the mean discharge values are for the winter months. They seem to decrease 
to September and then increase again in October re-starting the cycle. 

### Median Discharge
```{r,fig.cap= "**Figure 7.** Trends for the upstream site in the Delaware River using median discharge data from 1995 to 2021."}
#Upstream Site
ggplot(q_month_means, aes(x = year, y = q_median), size = 1.5) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~month, scales = 'free') +
  scale_y_log10()+
  ylab('Median Discharge (cfs)') +
  xlab('Year')
```
**Figure 7**, is very similar to **Figure 4.** however, the data plots are closer 
together making it a little easier to see increasing trends for all months. Showing 
that over time, the discharge rate upstream in the Delaware River is increasing. 

With discharge increasing in the Delaware River, let's look at how Specific 
Conductivity plays into this. 

## Specific Conductivity Trends

### Upstream site
```{r, fig.cap= "**Figure 8.** Average specific conductivity trends for the upstream site in the Delaware River using data from 1995 to 2021."}
site_no1 <- "01463500"

Spec_Cond1 <- read.csv('data/spefcond1.csv')

sc1 <- readNWISuv(siteNumbers = site_no1, 
                parameterCd = '00095', 
                startDate = '1995-09-30', 
                endDate = '2021-01-01') %>% 
  rename(sc_um = X_00095_00000) %>% 
  addWaterYear(.) %>% 
  select(-agency_cd, -X_00095_00000_cd)

sc_mean_t <- sc1 %>%
  mutate(month = month(dateTime),
         year = year(dateTime)) %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarize(sc_mean1 = mean(sc_um, na.rm = T),
            sc_min1 = min(sc_um, na.rm = T),
            sc_median1 = median(sc_um))

ggplot(sc_mean_t, aes(x = year, y = sc_mean1), size = 2) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~month, scales = 'free') +
  scale_y_log10()+
  ylab('Mean Specific Conductivity') +
  xlab('Year')
```
**Figure 8.** shows the mean specific conductivity for the upstream site for the Delaware River, which August and September have the largest values.


### Middle site
```{r, eval=FALSE}
site_no2 <- "01482100" 

Spec_Cond2 <- read.csv('data/spefcond2.csv')

sc2 <- readNWISuv(siteNumbers = site_no2, 
                parameterCd = '00095') %>% 
  mutate(dateTime = lubridate::as_datetime(dateTime),
         date = lubridate::as_date(dateTime))%>%
  group_by(site_no, dateTime)%>%
  summarize(sc_um_min_2 = min(X_Lower.Sensor_00095_00000),
            sc_um_mean_2 = mean(X_Lower.Sensor_00095_00000),
            sc_um_max_2 = max(X_Lower.Sensor_00095_00000))

sc_mean_dm <- sc2 %>%
  mutate(month = month(dateTime),
         year = year(dateTime)) %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarize(sc_mean2 = mean(sc_um_mean_2, na.rm = T),
            sc_min2 = min(sc_um_min_2, na.rm = T),
            sc_max2 = max(sc_um_max_2))

ggplot(sc_mean_dm, aes(x = year, y = sc_mean2), size = 2) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~month, scales = 'free') +
  scale_y_log10()+
  ylab('Mean Specific Conductivity') +
  xlab('Year')
```


### Estuary site
```{r, eval=FALSE}
site_no3 <- "01412350" 

Spec_Cond3 <- read.csv('data/spefcond3.csv')

sc3 <- readNWISuv(siteNumbers = site_no3, 
                parameterCd = '00095', 
                startDate = '2021-03-01', 
                endDate = '2022-04-07') %>% 
  rename(sc_um_3 = X_Lower_00095_00000) %>% 
  addWaterYear(.) %>%
  select(-agency_cd, -X_Upper_00095_00000_cd, -X_Upper_00095_00000,
        -X_Lower_00095_00000_cd, -tz_cd)

sc_mean_sj <- sc3 %>%
  mutate(month = month(dateTime),
         year = year(dateTime)) %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarize(sc_mean3 = mean(sc_um_3, na.rm = T),
            sc_min3 = min(sc_um_3, na.rm = T),
            sc_max3 = max(sc_um_3))

ggplot(sc_mean_sj, aes(x = year, y = sc_mean3)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~month, scales = 'free') +
  scale_y_log10()+

  xlab('Year')
```

### Comparing middle and estuary site's Specific Conductivity

```
![](sc2_3-legend2.png){width=30%}
Looking at **Figure 9.** which shows specific conductivity at the Middle and Estuary sites, we can see that the Estuary has a lot more saltwater which makes sense for it's location. However, the middle site has more dramatic increases in saltwater that occur in July and January. 

```{r}
#Mann-Kendall Test (Middle Site)
mk.test(log10(sc_dm_sj$sc_mean2))

sens.slope(log10(sc_dm_sj$sc_mean2))

sc_2_mk <- sens.slope((sc_dm_sj$sc_mean2))

#Mann-Kendall Test (Estuary Site)
mk.test(log10(sc_dm_sj$sc_mean3))

sens.slope(log10(sc_dm_sj$sc_mean3))

sc_3_mk <- sens.slope((sc_dm_sj$sc_mean3))

print(sc_2_mk)
print(sc_3_mk)
```


## Discharge vs. Specific Conductivity Trends at Upstream Site

```{r, fig.cap= "**Figure 10.** Comparison of the Delaware River's upstream site discharge and specific conductivity from 1995 to 2021."}
#Upstream Site
q_month_means <- q_month_means %>%
  mutate(day =1)

q_month_means$Date <- as.Date(with(q_month_means, paste(year, month, day, sep= "-")), '%Y-%m-%d')


sc_mean_t <- sc_mean_t %>%
  mutate(day = 1)

sc_mean_t$Date <- as.Date(with(sc_mean_t, paste(year, month, day, sep= "-")), '%Y-%m-%d')


q_sc_t <- right_join(q_month_means, sc_mean_t, by = 'Date')

p2 <- ggplot(q_sc_t) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = q_mean),  color ="blue") +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = sc_mean1*100), color = "red")+
  xlab('Water Year')+
  scale_y_log10()+
  ylab('Q') +
  theme_classic()

p2 + scale_y_continuous(name = "Discharge (cfs)", sec.axis = sec_axis(trans =~. / 100, name= "Specific Conductivity"))+
  theme_few(base_size =20)+
  scale_color_identity(guide = "legend")+
  ggtitle("Upstream Site")

```
**Figure 10.** shows how discharge and specific conductivity act with each other. 
With the red line marking specific conductivity, all of the highest points are 
when discharge has it's lowest points. This tells us that discharge and speicific 
conductivity have a relationship where salt water intrudes further when flow is 
at it's lowest. Using the Mann-Kendall test, the trend is significant with a slight 
slope of 0.15. 

```{r}
#Mann-Kendall Test (Upstream Site Discharge)
mk.test(log10(q_sc_t$q_mean))

sens.slope(log10(q_sc_t$q_mean))

up_q_mk <- sens.slope((q_sc_t$q_mean))

#Mann-Kendall Test (Upstream Site SC)
mk.test(log10(q_sc_t$sc_mean1))

sens.slope(log10(q_sc_t$sc_mean1))

up_sc_mk <- sens.slope((q_sc_t$sc_mean1))

print(up_q_mk)
print(up_sc_mk)
```


```{r, fig.cap= "**Figure 11** Comparing discharge to specific conductivity in
relation to each other from 1995 to 2021 at the Upstream site." }
