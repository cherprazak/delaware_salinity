There are people who prefer not believe in it and there are people who are very passionate about it. The changes that have been recorded are small, but important for many systems on Earth. These include an increase of around one degree Celsius and an increase in sea level by 6 to 8 inches. These play a big part in changing pieces of our lives that we dont notice on a day to day basis. With the sea level rising, the amount of coastal erosion has increased by a large amount. This has been decimating beaches and taking down coastal cliffs. There is already a hard time with upkeep of buildings and equipment because of the salt in the air which is corrosive over time. This corrosivity breaks down concrete and can cause a lot of problems with stability. So, you can imagine how easily this can break down rocks and beaches. The rising in sea levels also leads to a loss of deltas, marshes, and wetlands that have important ecosystems that they house. Now you might be wondering how a rising sea level affects you and you would be surprised by how much you should care. With all of these impacts, there are ones that you dont typically see yourself. If you live by a stream that lets out into the ocean, there are more impacts to be worried about. Such as when the tide comes in and sea water intrudes into the freshwater areas. Now any pipes or equipment that were used to take freshwater will have to be cleaned more often to keep from corroding. And with sea levels rising, these saltwater intrusions will keep going further into these freshwater areas, impacting more and more parts of the stream. Now if we focus on the Delaware River in New Jersey, we can look at the saltwater intrusion and how it has changed over the last few years. We can take this and compare it to sea levels in order to show how they are related and rely on each other(Gay and ODonnell 2009).

There is a lot of variation over the years that can be seen in this graph ranging from 0 to over 200,000 cfs.
