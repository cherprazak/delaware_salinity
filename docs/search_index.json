There are people who prefer not believe in it and there are people who are very passionate about it. The changes that have been recorded are small, but important for many systems on Earth. These include an increase of around one degree Celsius and an increase in sea level by 6 to 8 inches (epa_climate_2021?). These play a big part in changing parts of our lives that we don’t notice on a day to day basis. With the sea level rising, the amount of coastal erosion has increased by a large amount. This has been decimating beaches and taking down coastal cliffs by breaking down the sediments, forcing these structures to loose their stability. Leading to a loss of deltas, marshes, and wetlands that house important ecosystems. Saltwater is corrosive over time and also makes it more difficult for buildings and equipment to keep their strength. This means that buildings and equipment need constant upkeep so they don’t erode like the river banks (epa_climate_2021-1?). Looking at the tide coming into the Delaware Bay, sea water flows towards the freshwater and will flow upstream at the bottom of the river. This is due to the difference in densities of water, with saltwater being more dense than freshwater. As more construction is done along the banks of the Delaware, the more susceptible the river is to saltwater intrusion. The Delaware river flows for 301 miles along Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; there is a large amount of people that rely on this river for their everyday water. All of Philadelphia’s water and 50% of New York City’s water comes from the Delaware River, making it a very important source of water. However, this means that there is more groundwater pumping which pulls saltwater further into the Delaware. Therefore increasing saltwater intrusion and erosion along the river banks. Now if we focus on the Delaware River in New Jersey, we can look at the saltwater intrusion and how it has changed over the last few years. In Figure 1., the salt front is shown in the Delaware River, which differs everyday. The day shown, November 30th in 1964, displays the salt front about half way through the Middle and Upstream site. I want to see how much more upstream the salt front travels in 2021. Through discharge and conductivity data, we can understand how rising sea levels are impacting the salt front on the Delaware (gay_comparison_2009?). Figure 1. Salt Front on the Delaware River as seen on November 30th, 1964 from the Delaware River Basin Commission using USGS data. Upstream, Middle, and Estuary sites are labeled. 1.1 Question With sea levels rising globally, how has saltwater intrusion affected the Delaware River and the people that rely on it’s water?

Trends for all 12 months mean discharge data from 1995 to 2021 for the upstream site in the Delaware River. On Figure 4. we see all of the mean discharge values for the water years from 1995 to 2021. Going month to month, it is difficult to see any notable trends and when the Mann-Kendall test is applied, it proves that most of the trends are non-significant. November through May have much higher mean discharge values from winter weather, which I am avoiding in my research mainly due to the application of road salt. June and July values are a little bit lower, but still have a slight increasing trend over the years. Let’s look at the plots for August and September to see how their mean discharge values behave. 4.1.3 Mann-Kendall Test of August and September Trends #Upstream Site plot of August Trends q_aug &lt;- q_month_means %&gt;% filter(month == 8) ggplot(q_aug, aes(x = year, y = q_mean), size = 2) + geom_line() + scale_y_log10()+ ylab(&#39;Mean Discharge (cfs)&#39;) + xlab(&#39;Water Year&#39;) Figure 4.2: Figure 5.

So when we apply the Mann-Kendall test, we find a significant trend with a slope of 150.27. Proving that discharge is increasing over time especially in August. #Upstream Site plot of September Trends q_sept &lt;- q_month_means %&gt;% filter(month == 9) ggplot(q_sept, aes(x = year, y = q_mean), size = 1.5) + geom_line() + scale_y_log10()+ ylab(&#39;Mean Discharge (cfs)&#39;) + xlab(&#39;Water Year&#39;) Figure 4.3: Figure 6. September trends for the upstream site in the Delaware River using mean discharge data from 1995 to 2021. #Mann-Kendall Test mk.test(log10(q_sept$q_mean)) ## ## Mann-Kendall trend test ## ## data: log10(q_sept$q_mean) ## z = 0.13225, n = 26, p-value = 0.8948 ## alternative hypothesis: true S is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## S varS tau ## 7.000000e+00 2.058333e+03 2.153846e-02 sens.slope(log10(q_sept$q_mean)) ## ## Sen&#39;s slope ## ## data: log10(q_sept$q_mean) ## z = 0.13225, n = 26, p-value = 0.8948 ## alternative hypothesis: true z is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.01243574 0.01360223 ## sample estimates: ## Sen&#39;s slope ## 0.0003784566 up_sept_mk &lt;- sens.slope((q_sept$q_mean)) print(up_sept_mk) ## ## Sen&#39;s slope ## ## data: (q_sept$q_mean) ## z = 0.13225, n = 26, p-value = 0.8948 ## alternative hypothesis: true z is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -127.2727 135.4444 ## sample estimates: ## Sen&#39;s slope ## 2.8 Now Looking at Figure 6. for September, there does not seem to be any visible trends and the majority of the points lie between 3000 and 6000 cfs with some much higher outliers. Applying the Mann-Kendall test gives us a non-significant trend with a 2.8 slope. Telling us that the average discharge is also increasing for the month of September, just not as much as August. It makes sense for August to have larger values than September because of how large the mean discharge values are for the winter months. They seem to decrease to September and then increase again in October re-starting the cycle. 4.1.4 Median Discharge #Upstream Site ggplot(q_month_means, aes(x = year, y = q_median), size = 1.5) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~month, scales = &#39;free&#39;) + scale_y_log10()+ ylab(&#39;Median Discharge (cfs)&#39;) + xlab(&#39;Year&#39;) Figure 4.4: Figure 7. Trends for the upstream site in the Delaware River using median discharge data from 1995 to 2021. Figure 7, is very similar to Figure 4. however, the data plots are closer together making it a little easier to see increasing trends for all months. Showing that over time, the discharge rate upstream in the Delaware River is increasing. With discharge increasing in the Delaware River, let’s look at how Specific Conductivity plays into this. 4.2 Specific Conductivity Trends 4.2.1 Upstream site site_no1 &lt;- &quot;01463500&quot; Spec_Cond1 &lt;- read.csv(&#39;data/spefcond1.csv&#39;) sc1 &lt;- readNWISuv(siteNumbers = site_no1, parameterCd = &#39;00095&#39;, startDate = &#39;1995-09-30&#39;, endDate = &#39;2021-01-01&#39;) %&gt;% rename(sc_um = X_00095_00000) %&gt;% addWaterYear(.) %&gt;% select(-agency_cd, -X_00095_00000_cd) sc_mean_t &lt;- sc1 %&gt;% mutate(month = month(dateTime), year = year(dateTime)) %&gt;% group_by(year, month) %&gt;% summarize(sc_mean1 = mean(sc_um, na.rm = T), sc_min1 = min(sc_um, na.rm = T), sc_median1 = median(sc_um)) ggplot(sc_mean_t, aes(x = year, y = sc_mean1), size = 2) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~month, scales = &#39;free&#39;) + scale_y_log10()+ ylab(&#39;Mean Specific Conductivity&#39;) + xlab(&#39;Year&#39;) Figure 4.5: Figure 8. Average specific conductivity trends for the upstream site in the Delaware River using data from 1995 to 2021. Figure 8. shows the mean specific conductivity for the upstream site for the Delaware River, which August and September have the largest values. 4.2.2 Middle site site_no2 &lt;- &quot;01482100&quot; Spec_Cond2 &lt;- read.csv(&#39;data/spefcond2.csv&#39;) sc2 &lt;- readNWISuv(siteNumbers = site_no2, parameterCd = &#39;00095&#39;) %&gt;% mutate(dateTime = lubridate::as_datetime(dateTime), date = lubridate::as_date(dateTime))%&gt;% group_by(site_no, dateTime)%&gt;% summarize(sc_um_min_2 = min(X_Lower.Sensor_00095_00000), sc_um_mean_2 = mean(X_Lower.Sensor_00095_00000), sc_um_max_2 = max(X_Lower.Sensor_00095_00000)) sc_mean_dm &lt;- sc2 %&gt;% mutate(month = month(dateTime), year = year(dateTime)) %&gt;% group_by(year, month) %&gt;% summarize(sc_mean2 = mean(sc_um_mean_2, na.rm = T), sc_min2 = min(sc_um_min_2, na.rm = T), sc_max2 = max(sc_um_max_2)) ggplot(sc_mean_dm, aes(x = year, y = sc_mean2), size = 2) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~month, scales = &#39;free&#39;) + scale_y_log10()+ ylab(&#39;Mean Specific Conductivity&#39;) + xlab(&#39;Year&#39;) 4.2.3 Estuary site site_no3 &lt;- &quot;01412350&quot; Spec_Cond3 &lt;- read.csv(&#39;data/spefcond3.csv&#39;) sc3 &lt;- readNWISuv(siteNumbers = site_no3, parameterCd = &#39;00095&#39;, startDate = &#39;2021-03-01&#39;, endDate = &#39;2022-04-07&#39;) %&gt;% rename(sc_um_3 = X_Lower_00095_00000) %&gt;% addWaterYear(.) %&gt;% select(-agency_cd, -X_Upper_00095_00000_cd, -X_Upper_00095_00000, -X_Lower_00095_00000_cd, -tz_cd) sc_mean_sj &lt;- sc3 %&gt;% mutate(month = month(dateTime), year = year(dateTime)) %&gt;% group_by(year, month) %&gt;% summarize(sc_mean3 = mean(sc_um_3, na.rm = T), sc_min3 = min(sc_um_3, na.rm = T), sc_max3 = max(sc_um_3)) ggplot(sc_mean_sj, aes(x = year, y = sc_mean3)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~month, scales = &#39;free&#39;) + scale_y_log10()+ ylab(&#39;Mean Specific Conductivity&#39;) + xlab(&#39;Year&#39;) 4.2.4 Comparing middle and estuary site’s Specific Conductivity sc_mean_dm &lt;- sc_mean_dm %&gt;% mutate(day = 1) sc_mean_dm$Date &lt;- as.Date(with(sc_mean_dm, paste(year, month, day, sep= &quot;-&quot;)), &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;) sc_mean_sj &lt;- sc_mean_sj %&gt;% mutate(day = 1) sc_mean_sj$Date &lt;- as.Date(with(sc_mean_sj, paste(year, month, day, sep= &quot;-&quot;)), &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;) sc_dm_sj &lt;- right_join(sc_mean_dm, sc_mean_sj, by =&#39;Date&#39;) p1 &lt;- ggplot(sc_dm_sj) + geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = sc_mean2*10), color = &quot;Orange&quot;, size = 1.5)+ geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = sc_mean3), color = &quot;Green&quot;, size = 1.5)+ ylab(&#39;SC&#39;) + xlab(&#39;Water Year&#39;)+ theme_classic()+ scale_color_identity(guide = &quot;legend&quot;) p1 + scale_y_continuous(name = &quot;Estuary Site&quot;, sec.axis = sec_axis(trans =~. / 10, name= &quot;Middle Site&quot;))+ theme_few(base_size =20)+ ggtitle(&quot;Specific Conductivity&quot;) Figure 4.6: Figure 9. Mean Specific Conductivity trends for the Delaware River’s Middle site and Estuary site from March 2021 to April 2022. Looking at Figure 9. which shows specific conductivity at the Middle and Estuary sites, we can see that the Estuary has a lot more saltwater which makes sense for it’s location. However, the middle site has more dramatic increases in saltwater that occur in July and January. #Mann-Kendall Test (Middle Site) mk.test(log10(sc_dm_sj$sc_mean2)) ## ## Mann-Kendall trend test ## ## data: log10(sc_dm_sj$sc_mean2) ## z = -0.21898, n = 14, p-value = 0.8267 ## alternative hypothesis: true S is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## S varS tau ## -5.00000000 333.66666667 -0.05494505 sens.slope(log10(sc_dm_sj$sc_mean2)) ## ## Sen&#39;s slope ## ## data: log10(sc_dm_sj$sc_mean2) ## z = -0.21898, n = 14, p-value = 0.8267 ## alternative hypothesis: true z is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.06066400 0.05252087 ## sample estimates: ## Sen&#39;s slope ## -0.01274701 sc_2_mk &lt;- sens.slope((sc_dm_sj$sc_mean2)) #Mann-Kendall Test (Estuary Site) mk.test(log10(sc_dm_sj$sc_mean3)) ## ## Mann-Kendall trend test ## ## data: log10(sc_dm_sj$sc_mean3) ## z = 0, n = 14, p-value = 1 ## alternative hypothesis: true S is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## S varS tau ## 1.00000000 333.66666667 0.01098901 sens.slope(log10(sc_dm_sj$sc_mean3)) ## ## Sen&#39;s slope ## ## data: log10(sc_dm_sj$sc_mean3) ## z = 0, n = 14, p-value = 1 ## alternative hypothesis: true z is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.007520445 0.009434203 ## sample estimates: ## Sen&#39;s slope ## 0.0004781573 sc_3_mk &lt;- sens.slope((sc_dm_sj$sc_mean3)) print(sc_2_mk) ## ## Sen&#39;s slope ## ## data: (sc_dm_sj$sc_mean2) ## z = -0.21898, n = 14, p-value = 0.8267 ## alternative hypothesis: true z is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -69.43071 102.68736 ## sample estimates: ## Sen&#39;s slope ## -8.703923 print(sc_3_mk) ## ## Sen&#39;s slope ## ## data: (sc_dm_sj$sc_mean3) ## z = 0, n = 14, p-value = 1 ## alternative hypothesis: true z is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -357.2009 481.0441 ## sample estimates: ## Sen&#39;s slope ## 21.14285 4.3 Discharge vs. Specific Conductivity Trends at Upstream Site #Upstream Site q_month_means &lt;- q_month_means %&gt;% mutate(day =1) q_month_means$Date &lt;- as.Date(with(q_month_means, paste(year, month, day, sep= &quot;-&quot;)), &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;) sc_mean_t &lt;- sc_mean_t %&gt;% mutate(day = 1) sc_mean_t$Date &lt;- as.Date(with(sc_mean_t, paste(year, month, day, sep= &quot;-&quot;)), &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;) q_sc_t &lt;- right_join(q_month_means, sc_mean_t, by = &#39;Date&#39;) p2 &lt;- ggplot(q_sc_t) + geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = q_mean), color =&quot;blue&quot;) + geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = sc_mean1*100), color = &quot;red&quot;)+ xlab(&#39;Water Year&#39;)+ scale_y_log10()+ ylab(&#39;Q&#39;) + theme_classic() p2 + scale_y_continuous(name = &quot;Discharge (cfs)&quot;, sec.axis = sec_axis(trans =~. / 100, name= &quot;Specific Conductivity&quot;))+ theme_few(base_size =20)+ scale_color_identity(guide = &quot;legend&quot;)+ ggtitle(&quot;Upstream Site&quot;) Figure 4.7: Figure 10.

With the red line marking specific conductivity, all of the highest points are when discharge has it’s lowest points. This tells us that discharge and speicific conductivity have a relationship where salt water intrudes further when flow is at it’s lowest.

Looking at trends in discharge rates, Figure 4. shows how mean discharge has changed from 1995 to 2021 for each of the twelve months of the year. For this project, I decided to not discuss the trends for November through May due to the application of road salt in the winter. Because of this, I looked at August and September trends more closely After looking at data for saltwater intrusion in the Delaware River between 1995 and 2021, the future of this important waterway has become clear. With global sea levels rising, the salt front will continue to travel further upstream, increasing the opportunity of damage to equipment in the river and issues with obtaining drinking water. As said in the introduction, the Delaware River is used for 50% of New York City’s drinking water and all of Philadelphia’s drinking water along with many other cities in that area. As salt water travels further upstream, there will be a lose in drinkable water, ultimately forcing these important cities to find freshwater elsewhere. Doing so will be more expensive and worse for the environment as there will be an increase in having to transport water over long distances. In a river like the Delaware that has a well mixed estuary, the response to river discharge is surprisingly weak(garvine_axial_1992?) Now if we focus on the Delaware River in New Jersey, we can look at the saltwater intrusion and how it has changed over the last few years. We can take this and compare it to sea levels in order to show how they are related and rely on each other(gay_comparison_2009?).In a river like the Delaware that has a well mixed estuary, the response to river discharge is surprisingly weak(garvine_axial_1992?).
