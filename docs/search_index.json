There are people who prefer not believe in it and there are people who are very passionate about it. The changes that have been recorded are small, but important for many systems on Earth. These include an increase of around one degree Celsius and an increase in sea level by 6 to 8 inches (EPA 2021b). These play a big part in changing pieces of our lives that we dont notice on a day to day basis. With the sea level rising, the amount of coastal erosion has increased by a large amount. This has been decimating beaches and taking down coastal cliffs. There is already a hard time with upkeep of buildings and equipment because of the salt in the air which is corrosive over time. This corrosivity breaks down concrete and can cause a lot of problems with stability (EPA 2021a). So, you can imagine how easily this can break down rocks and beaches. The rising in sea levels also leads to a loss of deltas, marshes, and wetlands that have important ecosystems that they house. Now you might be wondering how a rising sea level affects you and you would be surprised by how much you should care. With all of these impacts, there are ones that you dont typically see yourself. If you live by a stream that lets out into the ocean, there are more impacts to be worried about. Such as when the tide comes in and sea water intrudes into the freshwater areas. Now any pipes or equipment that were used to take freshwater will have to be cleaned more often to keep from corroding (EPA 2021a). And with sea levels rising, these saltwater intrusions will keep going further into these freshwater areas, impacting more and more parts of the stream. Now if we focus on the Delaware River in New Jersey, we can look at the saltwater intrusion and how it has changed over the last few years. We can take this and compare it to sea levels in order to show how they are related and rely on each other(Gay and ODonnell 2009).In a river like the Delaware that has a well mixed estuary, the response to river discharge is suprisingly weak(Garvine, McCarthy, and Wong 1992). 1.1 Question Differing salinity levels through specific conductivity and how it affects the local ionic compounds.

It does look like the best fit line would be a straight line around 225 cfs, with some outliers that are either much higher or lower. The reason for there not being much of a trend here is due to how large the Delaware River is, making it difficult for it to be affected by anything. 3.5 August Trends q_aug &lt;- q_month_means %&gt;% filter(month == 8) ggplot(q_aug, aes(x = year, y = q_mean)) + geom_point() + scale_y_log10()+ ylab(&#39;Q (cfs)&#39;) + xlab(&#39;Water Year&#39;) 3.6 Minimum and Median Q Plot #Mean ggplot(q_month_means, aes(x = year, y = q_mean)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~month, scales = &#39;free&#39;) + scale_y_log10() #Minimum ggplot(q_month_means, aes(x = year, y = q_min)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~month, scales = &#39;free&#39;) + scale_y_log10() #Median ggplot(q_month_means, aes(x = year, y = q_median)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~month, scales = &#39;free&#39;) + scale_y_log10() Describe what you see here without a trend test: At this site in the Delaware River at Trenton, there are not many trends that can be seen over the months. For the mean, the values are all over the place and the only kind of trends would be straight lines with outliers. For the minimum values, the data seems to be a little more consise than with the mean values. So it would be easier to put a trend line in, but it is still all over the place where I cant say whether the values are increasing or decreasing. For the median values, they are also all over the place like with the mean values. In March, April, and September there is a slight increasing trend that can be seen. The rest have no trends due to the Delaware River being so large. 3.7 Specific Conductivity Trends site_no &lt;- &quot;01463500&quot; q &lt;- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = site_no, parameterCd = &#39;00095&#39;, startDate = &#39;1995-09-30&#39;, endDate = &#39;2021-01-01&#39;) %&gt;% rename(q_cfs = X_00095_00003) %&gt;% addWaterYear(.) %&gt;% select(-agency_cd, -X_00095_00003_cd) q_month_means2 &lt;- q %&gt;% mutate(month = month(Date), year = year(Date)) %&gt;% group_by(year, month) %&gt;% summarize(q_mean = mean(q_cfs, na.rm = T), q_min = min(q_cfs, na.rm = T), q_median = median(q_cfs)) ## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;year&#39;.

However, if you look at them closely, most do seem to have a slight increase in their values.
