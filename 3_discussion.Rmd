# Discussion

Here is my discussion post.

Looking at trends in discharge rates, **Figure 4.** shows how mean discharge has
changed from 1995 to 2021 for each of the twelve months of the year. For this project, 
I decided to not discuss the trends for November through May due to the application 
of road salt in the winter. Because of this, I looked at August and September trends  
more closely


After looking at data for saltwater intrusion in the Delaware River between 
1995 and 2021, the future of this important waterway has become clear. With 
global sea levels rising, the salt front will continue to travel further upstream, 
increasing the opportunity of damage to equipment in the river and issues with 
obtaining drinking water. As said in the introduction, the Delaware River is used 
for 50% of New York City's drinking water and all of Philadelphia's drinking water 
along with many other cities in that area. As salt water travels further upstream, 
there will be a lose in drinkable water, ultimately forcing these important cities to 
find freshwater elsewhere. Doing so will be more expensive and worse for the 
environment as there will be an increase in having to transport water over 
long distances. 




In a river like the Delaware that has a well mixed 
estuary, the response to river discharge is surprisingly weak[@garvine_axial_1992]

Now if we focus on the Delaware River in New Jersey, we can look at the saltwater 
intrusion and how it has changed over the last few years. We can take this and 
compare it to sea levels in order to show how they are related and rely on each 
other[@gay_comparison_2009].In a river like the Delaware that has a well mixed
