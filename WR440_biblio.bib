	abstract = {226Ra and 228Ra have non-conservative excess concentrations in the mixing zones of the Pee Dee River-Winyah Bay estuary, the Yangtze River estuary, and the Delaware Bay estuary. Laboratory experiments, using Pee Dee River sediment, indicate desorption of 226Ra to increase with increasing salinities up to 20‰. In Winyah Bay desorption from river-borne sediments could contribute almost all of the increases for both isotopes. Desorption adds only a portion of the excess 228Ra measured in the Yangtse River and adjacent Shelf waters and Delaware Bay. In the Yangtze River the mixing zone extends over a considerable portion of the Continental Shelf where 228Ra is added to the water column by diffusion from bottom sediments, while 226Ra concentrations decrease from dilution. Diffusion of 228Ra from bottom sediments in Delaware Bay primarily occurs in the upper part of the bay ({\textless} 22‰ water) where fine grained sediments predominate. A diffusive flux for 228Ra of 0·33 dpm cm−2 year was determined for Delaware Bay.},

	abstract = {This paper evaluates the worldwide oceanic distribution of228Ra. Nearshore waters, especially waters from restricted bays and sounds, are very high in unsupported228Ra. The concentrations decrease away from land. The228Ra content of surface waters bears a close correlation with the proximity to land. Samples from the Atlantic Ocean are higher than those from the Pacific Ocean. Apparently the source of228Ra in surface waters is diffusion from232Th-bearing sediments in contact with these waters. Deep water samples collected {\textless} 100m from the sea floor have significant228Ra concentrations. Apparently228Ra is diffusing from deep-sea sediments as it is from nearshore sediments. Deep Pacific samples are generally lower than deep Atlantic samples. This may mean that228Ra released from Pacific sediments is mixed upward more rapidly, thereby decreasing the near-bottom concentrations. Intermediate water samples have less228Ra than either surface or bottom samples from the same area. These concentrations are near the lower limit of detection. Because the vertical mixing rate of the ocean is much greater than the mean life of228Ra, little228Ra can penetrate into the intermediate ocean.},

	abstract = {Abstract Coastal buoyant outflows from rivers and estuaries previously have been studied with field research, laboratory experiments, and numerical models. There is a dire need to evaluate model performance in light of coastal current observations. This research simulates the Delaware Bay outflow and compares results with observations of estuarine and shelf conditions. Observations include an estuarine salinity climatology, a record of freshwater delivery to the shelf, coastal current salinity mappings, and surface drifter data. Simulation efforts focus on spring 1993 and spring 1994, the primary field study period. The simulation is forced with river discharge, winds, and tides; only tidal-averaged results are discussed. Estuarine salinity results are consistent with the observed lateral salinity pattern, vertical structure, and response to river discharge. Salinities within the lower bay agree with observations, but the simulation overestimates the along-estuary salinity gradient. Observed and simulated freshwater delivery exhibit the same amplitude of response to river discharge and winds. The simulation produces a buoyant outflow that is generally consistent with the observed buoyancy signature, width, length, and vertical structure over a variety of river discharge and wind conditions. The simulated coastal current, however, tends to be somewhat shorter and fresher than observed. Simulated surface drifter paths exhibit the observed onshore advection during downwelling winds as well as offshore transport and current reversals during upwelling winds. A statistical evaluation based on shelf salinity mappings indicates that the model reproduces the observed variance and has only a small bias (less than 10\% of plume buoyancy signature). The rms error of 1.2 psu is linked to the shorter and fresher nature of the simulated coastal current. Observational comparisons discussed in this paper indicate that the model can simulate many coastal current features and its response to river discharge and wind forcing.},

	abstract = {Long records of monthly salinity observations along the axis of Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, and Long Island Sound are used to test a simple advection–dispersion model of the salt distribution in linearly tapered estuaries developed in a previous paper. We subdivide each estuary into three to five segments, each with linear taper allowing a distributed input of fresh water, and evaluate the dispersion in each segment. While Delaware Bay has weak dispersion and a classical sigmoidal salinity structure, Long Island Sound and Chesapeake Bay are more dispersive and have relatively small gradients in the central stretches. Long Island Sound is distinguished by having a net volume and salt flux out of its low-salinity end resulting in a smaller range of salinity and increasing axial gradients at its head rather than the usual asymptotic approach to zero salinity. Estimates of residence times based on model transport coefficients show that Long Island Sound has the most rapid response to fresh-water flux variations. It also has the largest amplitude cycle in river discharge fluctuation. In combination, these cause the large seasonal variation in the salinity structure relative to interannual variability in Long Island Sound as compared with Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay.},

The shipboard measurements were made with a thermosalinograph on board the R/V Cape Henlopen. On 29–30 April 1993, the R/V Cape Henlopen sailed from the mouth of Delaware Bay south toward Chesapeake Bay in an east–west zig-zag pattern, repeatedly crossing the coastal current. The aircraft, a NASA P-3, flew the same lines on the afternoon of 30 April. Both thermosalinograph- and microwave radiometer–derived salinity maps clearly show the freshwater signature of the coastal current and generally are in agreement to within about 1 psu.},

The Delaware is a weakly stratified estuary with a typical vertical salinity variation of only 1 psu. We find that over most of the estuarine salt intrusion length the mean axial distribution of salinity is surprisingly close to a linear decrease with axial distance. Using linear regression analysis, we find that the response of salinity to river discharge is surprisingly weak. The equivalent displacement of a given isohaline for a change in discharge of one standard deviation is only about 4 km, about half the amplitude of the M2 tidal displacement. This implies that some powerful buffering agent exists to reduce the salinity response. We suggest two possible mechanisms for this agent: the action of vertical shear flow dispersion in a tidally stirred regime and the action of lateral shear coupled to strong lateral salinity gradients.},

President Biden’s Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, requires federal agencies to develop Climate Action Plans that describe their agency’s climate vulnerabilities and the steps it will take to bolster adaptation and increase resilience to the impacts of climate change.
This 2021 EPA Climate Adaptation Action Plan (“Plan”) builds on a strong foundation. The agency released its first Climate Change Adaptation Plan in June 2014, followed by 17 Climate Change Adaptation Implementation Plans prepared by its National Environmental Program Offices, National Support Offices, and 10 Regional Offices. The 2021 Plan accelerates action and focuses agency attention on priority actions it will take to fulfill our mission and increase human and ecosystem resilience even as the climate changes.
This Plan will be followed by updates to the 17 Implementation Plans produced in 2014. Every office will report on its progress since 2014 and identify future actions to address the agency-wide priorities identified in this Plan. EPA offices will engage with states, tribes, territories, local communities, and other stakeholders when updating their plans.},
