	abstract = {226Ra and 228Ra have non-conservative excess concentrations in the mixing zones of the Pee Dee River-Winyah Bay estuary, the Yangtze River estuary, and the Delaware Bay estuary. Laboratory experiments, using Pee Dee River sediment, indicate desorption of 226Ra to increase with increasing salinities up to 20‰. In Winyah Bay desorption from river-borne sediments could contribute almost all of the increases for both isotopes. Desorption adds only a portion of the excess 228Ra measured in the Yangtse River and adjacent Shelf waters and Delaware Bay. In the Yangtze River the mixing zone extends over a considerable portion of the Continental Shelf where 228Ra is added to the water column by diffusion from bottom sediments, while 226Ra concentrations decrease from dilution. Diffusion of 228Ra from bottom sediments in Delaware Bay primarily occurs in the upper part of the bay ({\textless} 22‰ water) where fine grained sediments predominate. A diffusive flux for 228Ra of 0·33 dpm cm−2 year was determined for Delaware Bay.},

	abstract = {The first224Ra (t1/2 = 3.64days) measurements from mixing zones of estuarine systems are presented for the Pee Dee River-Winyah Bay and Delaware Bay Estuaries. High-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry was used to determine224Ra,228Ra (t1/2 = 5.7years), and226Ra (t1/2 = 1622years) activity ratios. Desorption and diffusion from suspended and bottom sediments contributes to the non-conservative increases of the three isotopes in each systems. In Delaware Bay224Ra concentrations were nearly constant over the 2.5‰ to 15‰ salinity range where two turbidity maximum zones are located.228Th scavenging onto the suspended particles in the turbid zones may supply a regenerative source of224Ra in this system. Samples collected on the ebb and flood tide from a salt marsh along Delaware Bay have a 5-fold increase in224Ra from flood to ebb and 3- and 2-fold increases for228Ra and226Ra respectively, indicating salt marshes are another source of radium to estuarine waters.},
