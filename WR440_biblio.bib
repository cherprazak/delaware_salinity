	abstract = {Long records of monthly salinity observations along the axis of Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, and Long Island Sound are used to test a simple advection–dispersion model of the salt distribution in linearly tapered estuaries developed in a previous paper. We subdivide each estuary into three to ﬁve segments, each with linear taper allowing a distributed input of fresh water, and evaluate the dispersion in each segment. While Delaware Bay has weak dispersion and a classical sigmoidal salinity structure, Long Island Sound and Chesapeake Bay are more dispersive and have relatively small gradients in the central stretches. Long Island Sound is distinguished by having a net volume and salt ﬂux out of its low-salinity end resulting in a smaller range of salinity and increasing axial gradients at its head rather than the usual asymptotic approach to zero salinity. Estimates of residence times based on model transport coefﬁcients show that Long Island Sound has the most rapid response to fresh-water ﬂux variations. It also has the largest amplitude cycle in river discharge ﬂuctuation. In combination, these cause the large seasonal variation in the salinity structure relative to interannual variability in Long Island Sound as compared with Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay.},

	abstract = {A comparison is presented of remote and shipboard measurements of sea surface salinity made in the vicinity of the Delaware coastal current, a low salinity band with its source in the mouth of Delaware Bay. The remote sensing measurements were made from an aircraft with the Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer. The shipboard measurements were made with a thermosalinograph on board the R/V Cape Henlopen. On 29–30 April 1993, the R/V Cape Henlopen sailed from the mouth of Delaware Bay south toward Chesapeake Bay in an east–west zig-zag pattern, repeatedly crossing the coastal current. The aircraft, a NASA P-3, ﬂew the same lines on the afternoon of 30 April. Both thermosalinograph- and microwave radiometer–derived salinity maps clearly show the freshwater signature of the coastal current and generally are in agreement to within about 1 psu.},

	abstract = {Coastal buoyant outflows from rivers and estuaries previously have been studied with field research, laboratory experiments, and numerical models. There is a dire need to evaluate model performance in light of coastal current observations. This research simulates the Delaware Bay outflow and compares results with observations of estuarine and shelf conditions. Observations include an estuarine salinity climatology, a record of freshwater delivery to the shelf, coastal current salinity mappings, and surface drifter data. Simulation efforts focus on spring 1993 and spring 1994, the primary field study period. The simulation is forced with river discharge, winds, and tides; only tidal-averaged results are discussed. Estuarine salinity results are consistent with the observed lateral salinity pattern, vertical structure, and response to river discharge. Salinities within the lower bay agree with observations, but the simulation overestimates the along-estuary salinity gradient. Observed and simulated freshwater delivery exhibit the same amplitude of response to river discharge and winds. The simulation produces a buoyant outflow that is generally consistent with the observed buoyancy signature, width, length, and vertical structure over a variety of river discharge and wind conditions. The simulated coastal current, however, tends to be somewhat shorter and fresher than observed. Simulated surface drifter paths exhibit the observed onshore advection during downwelling winds as well as offshore transport and current reversals during upwelling winds. A statistical evaluation based on shelf salinity mappings indicates that the model reproduces the observed variance and has only a small bias (less than 10\% of plume buoyancy signature). The rms error of 1.2 psu is linked to the shorter and fresher nature of the simulated coastal current. Observational comparisons discussed in this paper indicate that the model can simulate many coastal current features and its response to river discharge and wind forcing.},
